## Purpose

A collection of my awesome projects that I've finished and am currently working on. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with [Chakra UI](https://next.chakra-ui.com/).

### Notes

- **Important: This is not meant to serve as a template. All of the code was written to my needs.**

- For Spotify tracks to work, you need to make a .env.local file at the root and fill it with your tokens. If you want to run it in production, replace all mentions of localhost with your production website. 

Credit is appreciated if any of my code is used :)
