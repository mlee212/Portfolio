            I'm a frontend web developer based in Southern California üòé
            studying Computer Science at the University of California at
            Riverside.

            I'm currently working on Citrushack, the largest hackathon offered
            by UCR. More updates soon to come!

            If I'm not coding, you can catch me perfecting the art of the
            grilled cheese ü•™ or building bespoke keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è. I'm typing on my
            Iron165 (my favorite board ever) with lubricated cream switches.
