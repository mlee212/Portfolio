## Who Cares?

We spend hours sitting in front of the screen whether it be writing the first chapter of a new novel or coding an automation script or beating that difficult level in a game.
<br/><br/>
The fact of the matter is, our keyboards go through alot. Approximately *five to eighty million keypresses* in its lifespan.
<br/><br/>
Now why shouldn't we make our experience typing on a keyboard more enjoyable given that we are spending so much time using it especially now during the pandemic? 
<br/><br/>
Enter: the <mark>custom mechanical keyboard</mark>. 
<br/><br/>
### The Typical Office Keyboard

Sure, you can pick up your run of the mill office keyboard with rubber domes but I think we can all agree that while it gets the job done, it doesn't feel good to get the job done. 
<br/><br/>
When broken down, the typical mass produced keyboard you can pick up from an office store is a circuit board with a matrix (like a road system) connecting all the key switches (the intersections within the road system) that registers each keypress using a rubber dome or membrane to give the user tactile feedback for each keypress. The typing experience can be described as mushy and slow given the mechanism of the switch. It gives an unpleasant tactile feedback that can be compared to pressing down against an overripe banana.
<br/><br/>
Now imagine spending *hours and hours* typing on one of those atrocious keyboards. Yeah. Unpleasant.
<br/><br/>
### The Mechanical Keyboard 

The difference between a membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard is the the mechanism underneath each keycap: Either a rubber dome, or a mechanical switch.
<br/><br/>
What if you hated tactility and instead prefer a keypress without any feedback asides from bottoming out the press? Or instead you want a keypress that provides a satisfying click sound on every press? Or instead you do want tactility but instead of the mushy feeling you get from a membrane keyboard, it actually feels good?
<br/><br/>
Well I am happy to share that there is a switch for everyone.
