### Purpose

A collection of my neat projects and ideas that I've finished and am currently working on. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

### Features

- Uses Next.JS :D
- Uses Tailwind CSS. Most components are modular.
- Has seamless light/dark mode.
- Uses modern image formats and size compression.
- It is my passion project.

### Notes

**Important: This is not meant to serve as a template. All of the code was written to my needs.**

- This project uses the Github and Spotify APIs to generate some neat data. You will need your own token from each to generate it.

Credit is appreciated if any of my code is used :)
