          You found my corner of the internet. Learn about how I want to make
          the web a beautiful place. I am a Junior at the University of
          California, Riverside studying Computer Science. But my real passion
          lies in frontend web development.

          If I am not coding, you can catch me perfecting the art of the grilled
          cheese or building bespoke keyboards. I'm typing on my Iron165 (my
          favorite board ever) with lubricated cream switches.

          You can also find me currently playing through Returnal. I'm always up
          for a conversation. Feel free to hit me up.
