## Who Cares?

We spend hours sitting in front of the screen whether it be writing the first chapter of a new novel or coding an automation script or beating that difficult level in a game.

The fact of the matter is, our keyboards go through alot. Approximately *five to eighty million keypresses* in its lifespan.

Now why shouldn't we make our experience typing on a keyboard more enjoyable given that we are spending so much time using it especially now during the pandemic? 

Enter: the *custom mechanical keyboard*. 

### The Typical Office Keyboard

Sure, you can pick up your run of the mill office keyboard with rubber domes but I think we can all agree that while it gets the job done, it doesn't feel good to get the job done. 

When broken down, the typical mass produced keyboard you can pick up from an office store is a circuit board with a matrix (like a road system) connecting all the key switches (the intersections within the road system) that registers each keypress using a rubber dome or membrane to give the user tactile feedback for each keypress. The typing experience can be described as mushy and slow given the mechanism of the switch. It gives an unpleasant tactile feedback that can be compared to pressing down against an overripe banana.

Now imagine spending *hours and hours* typing on one of those atrocious keyboards. Yeah. Unpleasant.

### The Mechanical Keyboard 

The difference between a membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard is the the mechanism underneath each keycap: Either a rubber dome, or a mechanical switch.

What if you hated tactility and instead prefer a keypress without any feedback asides from bottoming out the press? Or instead you want a keypress that provides a satisfying click sound on every press? Or instead you do want tactility but instead of the mushy feeling you get from a membrane keyboard, it actually feels good?

Well I am happy to share that there is a switch for everyone.

### Switches Explained

A switch is made up of several parts that determine the sound and feel of the typing experience but the main question that must be answered is what switch is right for you.

There are three main types of switches: linear, tactile, and clicky all of which have hundreds of different variants that span weights, actuation force, and material. 

#### Linear Switches

A popular example of a linear switch are the cherry red switches. They feature a lack of tactility or click with a weight of 45g of operating force and travel 2mm downward on a keypress. 

Now while these may be arguably the most popular linear switch, they aren't necessarily the best. Some highly regarded linear switches include gateron inks, novelkeys creams, and cherry vintage blacks which provide superior typing sound especially when they undergo a common modification of lubricating the switch which in turn smoothens out the friction of the plastic when the switch mechanism is pressed down. 

#### Tactile Switches

Don't like the feel of no feedback? Tactile switches provide a bump notifying typers of their keypresses in contrast to linear switches which provide no feedback asides from bottoming out.

This is where cherry browns are most known for but other switches such as holy pandas, topre, and kailh box brown switches are regarded as better feeling than cherry browns amongst keyboard enthusiasts.

#### Clicky Switches

The loudest of the three, these switches differ from other two by providing a satisfying click sound on each keypress but some complain that it is loud to type on. Different clicky switches also vary depending on the click mechanism which might involve a click bar like the kailh box whites or a click jacket like the cherry mx blues.

Some other variants include the kailh box navies, jades, and whites. 


### End Note

Each person will have a different preference on what sort of keyboard they want which makes it important to try out the choices before fully investing in one switch. 

To make this easier, hotswap boards allow users to try different switches without soldering. They are in high demand and considered a staple when first entering the world of mechanical keyboards.
