          What I'm About.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm a frontend web developer based in Southern California üòé studying
          Computer Science at the University of California at Riverside.
          <br />
          <br /> I'm currently working on Citrushack, the largest hackathon
          offered by UCR. More updates soon to come!
          <br />
          <br />
          If I'm not coding, you can catch me perfecting the art of the grilled
          cheese ü•™ or building bespoke keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è. I'm typing on my Iron165
          (my favorite board ever) with lubricated cream switches. <br />
          <br />
          You can also find me currently playing through <i>The Last of Us 2</i>
          .
